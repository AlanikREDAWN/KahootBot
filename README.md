# KahootBot

This Kahoot! Bot was inspired by a challenge set out in a Hack Club workshop on hacking Kahoot! The Bot is able to get the right answer every time. [Here](https://replit.com/@AlanikREDAWN/KahootBot?v=1) is a link to the Repl, where you should be able to fork it and run it. For it to work properly, you need to replace where it says GameCode with the code to the Kahoot! and where it says UserName, with your preferred username.
